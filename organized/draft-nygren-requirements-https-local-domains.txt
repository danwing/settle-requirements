                Requirements for HTTPS for Local Domains
          draft-nygren-requirements-https-local-domains-latest

Abstract

   When connecting to servers on their local network, users are
   surprised to encounter user interfaces that display errors, show
   insecure connections, and block some HTTP features when missing a
   secure context.  However, obtaining PKIX certificates for those
   servers is difficult for a variety of reasons.

   This document explores requirements for authenticating local servers
   without relying on PKIX certificates.

1.  Introduction

   Servers on local networks have historically used and encouraged
   unencrypted communications -- printers, routers, network attached
   storage (NAS).  However, browsers disadvantage unencrypted
   communications (e.g., [not-secure], [sec-context]) which increases
   importance of a secure context (HTTPS) to local domains.  Today, a
   secure context is obtained with a PKIX certificate ([RFC5280]) signed
   by a Certification Authority (CA) that is trusted by the client.

   However, servers on a local network cannot easily get PKIX
   certificates signed by a Certification Authority because of their
   firewall or NAT (to prove domain ownership), lack of domain name
   delegation, and need for ongoing certificate renewal.

   The problem has been well recognized since about 2017 and several
   proposals have been suggested to solve this problem, each with their
   own drawbacks.  This document is not intended to summarize these
   proposals or their drawbacks; for that detail see the pointers to
   previous work in Section 7.  At a high level, the proposals have
   involved solutions such as:

   *  pre-shared secrets (scanned, printed, or displayed by the server)

   *  Public DNS pointing at local domain's IP address (e.g., [plex])

   *  Local Certification Authority, where a CA is added to client's
      certificate trust list and that CA signs certificates for devices
      within the local network

   *  Trust On First Use (TOFU), where a user verifies the first
      connection to a server and the client remembers that verification,
      similar to common use of ssh

   *  WebRTC and WebTransport, where a PKI-signed server provides a
      public key fingerprint of another server that it has previously
      bootstrapped

   *  Encoding server's public key into the hostname [thomson-hld]

   This document explores IETF requirements for an alternative server
   authentication system for local hosts.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Technical Requirements

3.1.  Naming

   PKIX certificates are a centralized naming scheme derived from DNS.
   These names have (the possibility of) being human-readable names.
   But the most significant property is uniqueness -- each name has its
   own identity and that identity can be proven.

   A system that does not rely on centralized naming lacks this
   inherient uniqueness property.

   Without a centralized naming scheme, name collisions are possible and
   likely.  For example, it is likely that many networks will have a
   printer named, simply, "printer", much like many people might share a
   common name such as "John".  Humans prefer simple, human-readable
   names, but a strong identity cannot be created with such names: if
   two networks both have a printer named "printer", they are
   indistinguishable and if one responds when the other was expected,
   the mismatch will appear identical to an attack.  This would be
   unacceptable.

      R-UNIQUE-NAME: The system MUST have a way to uniquely identify
      servers.

3.2.  Cryptographic Binding

   A server's name has to be mapped to its cryptographic identity.

      R-BINDING: The Web Origin MUST be cryptographically bound to one
      or more key pairs, where the private keying material is on the
      service endpoint and where an attacker without the private key(s)
      is unable to access any state associated with the Web Origin.

   A client has to be able to validate the name maps to the
   cryptographic identity.

      R-VALIDATE: Clients MUST be able to cryptographically validate
      that the authenticating server matches the identity in the URI /
      Web Origin.

   Web browsers and modern users both expect a URI.

      R-URI: It MUST be possible to construct a URI that encapsulates a
      Web Origin and its cryptographically-bound identity information.

3.3.  Abstract Naming

   Using IP addresses in names is problematic if the server's IP address
   changes due to ISP renumbering or internal network DHCP server
   reconfiguration.

      R-ABSTRACT: The solution SHOULD abstract names from IP addresses.

   Any given name should be resolvable to a mixture of IPv4, IPv6 Link-
   Local (on an Interface), IPv6 ULA, and IPv6 Globally-Routable
   addresses.  Operating a local DNS is beyond the scope of many
   administrators, so being able to advertise the server using [DNS-SD]
   is necessary.

      R-DNS-SD: The name MUST be advertisable using [DNS-SD]

3.4.  Avoid Central Authority

   A solution needs to be self-contained and not use the central
   authority of PKIX.

      R-AVOID-CENTRAL: A solution SHOULD NOT (MUST NOT?) rely on central
      trust hierarchy.

   Vendors go out of business or lose interest in continuing to service
   old products.  The products may still be operational.

      R-AVOID-VENDOR: A solution SHOULD NOT (MUST NOT?) have continued
      reliance on a service operated by a vendor, including if the
      device is reset to factory defaults (e.g., reset for
      troubleshotting or because sold).

3.5.  Multiple Application Protocols

      R-MULT-APP: A solution MUST support various application-level
      protocols, especially HTTPS, IPPS, DoH, DoT, ande SMB over QUIC.

3.6.  Cryptographic Agility

      R-AGILITY: A solution SHOULD support crypto agility (such as
      supporting more than one active key type).

3.7.  TLS Server Name Indication

      R-TLS-SNI: A solution SHOULD support TLS SNI so a server knows
      which key pair/cert is expected.

3.8.  Localhost

      R-LOCALHOST: A solution SHOULD support "localhost" (e.g., for
      sending a user to connect to a local service)

3.9.  W3C Private Network Access

      R-PNA: A solution SHOULD integrate well with an evolution of
      [w3c-pna] and both allow for an improved model there but should
      also provide more robust solutions to vulnerabilities that it
      tries to address

3.10.  Constrain to Local Resources

      R-LOCAL: A solution SHOULD be constrained to .local and .internal.

      Discuss: MAY constrain to the DHCP domain-search value??  Should
      we also allow any arbitrary name if the IP address is local
      (RFC1918 address), too?

3.11.  Operate Standalone

   After configuration, the system needs to operate without a connection
   to the Internet.  This is necessary because Internet connectivity is
   sometimes flaky or unavailable (e.g., cabin in the woods).

      R-STANDALONE: MUST operate securely while Internet connectivity is
      unavailable.

3.12.  Technical Requirements

   1.  It SHOULD be possible to have a way to represent a URI that
       includes a single specific IP address and the cryptographic
       identity of the service endpoint.

      Discuss: the above requirement needs to be re-written.

   1.  SHOULD support key rotation (even if via 301 redirect) — Q: is it
       acceptable to state to be lost here?  Note: likely can’t do 301
       if doing TLS (HTTPS).  Is this suggestion to start HTTP and
       upgrade to HTTPS?  Could be useful for HTTPS but redirect
       unavailable for IPP, SMB, DoH.

      Discuss: the above requirement needs to be re-written.

   1.  SHOULD support building trust relationships within devices in the
       local environment

      Discuss: the above requirement needs to be re-written.

   1.  Could this help with HTTPS access to Wi-Fi login portals
       ([RFC8952], [RFC8910])?

      Discuss: the above requirement needs to be re-written.

4.  Human Factors Requirements

4.1.  Discoverable

      R-DISCOVER: A solution SHOULD have a way to do discovery of
      endpoints and their identities (for example, via [DNS-SD]).

4.2.  Easy to Use

      R-EASY: A solution SHOULD have human factors and adversarial
      testing on proposed solutions to make sure that this solution
      provides a reasonable experience to average and novice end-users
      and does not introduce new security exploitation vectors

4.3.  Bookmarkable

      R-BOOKMARK: A solution SHOULD have a URI that users can Bookmark
      to create an association to a friendly name.

      Discussion: Can URL bar of the browser honor mDNS/DNSSD advertised
      names, or give a pull-down of them similar to how the “add
      printer” dialog does for printers?  This would help ease the use
      of long FQDN so it’s almost as easy as router.local.  Especially
      if it could show a nickname that is configured by the printer.

4.4.  Human-friendly Name

      R-CONSISTENT: A solution SHOULD represent these URIs to humans in
      a consistent, readable, and non-confusing fashion.  (In a browser,
      users shouldn’t see the key fingerprint by default but rather a
      representation of its presence)

5.  Big Open Questions

5.1.  Key Rotation

   1.  Is it acceptable for the Web Origin to change as part of key
       rotations?  A: no, this doesn’t happen today and changing the web
       origin would violate the principle of least surprise.

5.2.  Trust on First Use (TOFU)

   Is TOFU acceptable?

      Note: TOFU is arguably what we have today with self-signed
      certificates which can be trusted (after the user accepts the
      warning message and adds the certificate to their client's trust
      store).

5.3.  User Experience

   For a solution, what is the User Experience for any trust
   relationship / web-of-trust?

5.4.  Trust Relationship

   For a solution, what is the nature of the trust relationship?

   *  Peer trust web?

   *  Central CA within the local environment / trust clearing house?

   *  Client establishes its own trust to the server

5.5.  Interaction with Matter/Thread

   How does a solution tie into systems like Matter/Thread that have
   their own trust establishment frameworks?

6.  Use Cases

   For the below, “Secure communications” means being able to make a TLS
   connection to a service such that the service is able to authenticate
   itself in a way to prevent MitM attacks.  The security model must be
   TOFU at a minimum, but when the identity of a service is none it
   should be possible to send it as a URI in such as a way to present a
   secure association rooted in the connection that sent it:

   *  Secure communications via HTTPS to admin interfaces on CPEs for
      both initial and ongoing configuration tasks of various servers
      (router, printer, NAS, etc.).

   *  Secure communications to DoH/DoT servers on CPEs

   *  Secure communications to printers (IPPS [RFC7472] printing)

   *  Secure communications to other local services (SMB over QUIC to
      another workstation or a NAS) and IoT devices

   *  Secure communications to localhost processes from a browser (e.g.,
      admin tools)

7.  Related

   Martin Thomson wrote a document on HTTPS for Local Domains which
   covers requirements, discusses several solutions and their tradeoffs,
   and suggests a solution with hostnames encoding the server's public
   key [thomson-hld] in November 2017.

   W3C worked on this problem from 2017 through 2021 [w3c-httpslocal].
   More recently, W3C had a workshop on the problem in September 2024
   [tpac].

   The boundaries of a limited domain -- such as the local domain
   described in this document -- are explored in Section 6 of [RFC8799].

   The IOTOPS working group and the associated IOT Security Foundation
   [iotsf] discussed the problem and some requirements in their white
   paper [iotops-suib] and presentation to IOTOPS working group at
   IETF112 [iotops-suib-prezo].

   A threshold key system is described and implemented at [phb-mesh]
   with the following description:

      The Mesh is designed to provide users with the highest level of
      security that is possible without asking them to do anything at
      all.  For this to become possible, the Mesh will have to be
      shipped to users as part of the machine Operating System.

   A summary of the problem and analysis of several solutions (Locally-
   installed CAs, Plex, WebRTC and WebTransport, TOFU, shared secrets)
   and some drawbacks of those solutions is at [stark].

   A method using PAKE and a shared secret (displayed on the server) is
   explained at [shared].
